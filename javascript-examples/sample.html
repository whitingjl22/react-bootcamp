<a href="">some-link-that-doesn't-go-anywhere</a>

<p>Oh wow, look at this amazing button I made!</p>

<p><button onclick="document.write('you clicked the button');">Click me, please!</button></p>

<p>The button doesn't do anything either, gotcha!! ðŸ¤­</p>

<script>
x = 5;
console.log('log statement that resolves to: ', x + 5);

for(let i = 0; i < x; i++){
	console.log('i: ', i);
};

let y_array = ["Coding", "Dojo", "is", "awesome!"];
console.log(y_array[3]); 

//loops through 1 to 10 and prints whether the number is odd or even
let j;
for(j=1; j<=10; j++){
    if(j%2 == 0) {
        console.log(j, ' is an Even number');
    }
    else {
        console.log(j, 'is an Odd number');
    }
}

let sum = (x,y) => {
    console.log('Got the following two parameters', x, y);
    return x+y;
}
console.log(sum(5,3));  //logs 8
console.log(sum(10,15) + sum(3,5));  //logs 33

</script>
